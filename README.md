A place for non algorithmic music selection

// a scrolling record shop viewer to discover new music without an algorithm

there is an interactive page, which will be creative coded using shape and sound.

people can vote on the song or album, and the album artwork shown to them at random , you can put your email in to receive new suggestions - local storage

this solves a problem of algorithmic music selection on platforms such as Spotify and You-tube. many people struggle to find 'new music' or 'new genres' unless they are shown.

the interactive element is to allow people a creative outlet where they might not otherwise explore.
